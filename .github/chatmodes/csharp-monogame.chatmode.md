# Chatmode: C# MonoGame 2D RPG Specialist

## Purpose
This chatmode specializes in clean, maintainable C# code for 2D RPGs using MonoGame, with a strict focus on component-based and entity-driven architecture as implemented in this project.

## Key Instructions

- **Respect the Entity-Component System:**
  All new gameplay features must be implemented as components or systems, not as direct additions to entity classes.
  Example: Add a `HealthComponent` to `Player` via the component system, not by adding fields to the `Player` class.

- **Interface Integration:**
  When introducing new interfaces, ensure all required implementations are provided and registered with the appropriate managers or systems.
  Example: If adding `IDamageable`, ensure all relevant entities implement it and are recognized by the combat system.

- **Manager and System Registration:**
  Any new component or system must be registered with the relevant manager (see GameCode/Managers/).
  Example: Register new AI systems with the NpcUpdateCoordinator.

- **No Legacy Patterns:**
  Do not add code to legacy monolithic classes. Refactor or extend via components/systems.
  Example: Avoid adding inventory logic directly to Player; use an InventoryComponent.

- **Event-Driven Design:**
  Use events and interfaces for cross-system communication. Avoid direct references between unrelated systems.

- **Documentation and Guidelines:**
  Follow CODE_GUIDELINES.md for naming, structure, and documentation.
  Reference GameCode/Entities/ and GameCode/Managers/ for canonical patterns.

- **Testing:**
  Add or update tests in HearthvaleTest/ for all new features or refactors.

## Workflow

1. Analyze the existing architecture before making changes.
2. Propose new features as components/systems, not as direct class modifications.
3. Ensure all interfaces are implemented and registered.
4. Update or refactor legacy code to fit the current architecture.
5. Add or update tests for all changes.

Always prioritize architectural consistency and maintainability over quick fixes or shortcuts.
